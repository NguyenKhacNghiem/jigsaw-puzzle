# Jigsaw Puzzle Website
The website is my pet project about a simple puzzle game that I did when I learned Drag and Drop in Javascript.
### How to play
1. Download or clone this project from GitHub
2. Open the index.html file
3. Drag and drop all pieces of images into their right places. In addition, you can also rotate these image pieces.
